224,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe.",3

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

Let me tell you any headphone takes a while to give its best and it takes few weeks of usage for that.
So right now i have used these for about 40 mins and listening to saved music in Poweramp as well as built in normal player and then lastly played songs on youtube.
I would say it sounds great on PowerAmp.

- Braided cable (I hope it's durable.)
- Ear tips feel comfortable even after long use.
- Sound quality is good. Though the sound signature is more
towards bass heavy.
- Magnets on the back of ear tips helps to keep them together.

Con's :
- It would have been better if the sound signature was on the
balanced side.

Kudos to Flipkart for quick and swift delivery.",5

432,Super!,"Got these headset after going through many reviews as i had previously used Jbl,boat, 1more etc. The so i was confused to either buy some costly headset or go for a bit cheaper. These headset are pretty loud with very good bass, even listening to soft music you can feel that song. I fel that it has good amount of bass with some surround sound effect.... Using it from past 2 weeks.. Satisfied till date.",5
433,Classy product,sound quality is crispy and clear. base is good . the material of the wire is very good . finally I got a good headphone . if you want a durable headphone then go for it . if not boat rockers are also good option . but I prefer durable headphone which can long last like 3 years,5
434,Brilliant,"awesome sound , awesome bass , awesome everything but sometimes the buds hurts in the ears a little....buds can be more soft and smooth and rather everything is cool.....a value for money product",5
435,Mind-blowing purchase,super super super very very good earphones best budget earphones thank you realme thank you Flipkart,5
436,Bad quality,"Vocal-- not clear.
Instrument separation --- not good.
Loudness- high
For pubg that's good enough . But as a music lover this is the worst.",2
437,Delightful,"Earphone got best fit in the ear, comes with extra buds, wire is pretty flexible, made by good quality material. Sound quality can be compared with earphones like that of JBL and BOAT, 3.5mm jack makes it more comfortable to use and fit in almost all mobile jacks. Bass quality is descent. Good for playing games like PUBGMobile, etc. Honestly the best earphones at low price.",4
438,Decent product,"Not bad at all, but I can find something more than this at this price segment i.e., 599. realme can improve well in realme buds 2 as I'm a pure realme user.
But in 18 months they progress like that I can't believe on it which is not by Oppo, OnePlus, Apple(iPhone), etc. I never negate Oppo, OnePlus and Apples progress but it's truly incredible by realme.
I have lots of faith on realme that they do well more than today.
As a real realme user I wish grow well you my artificial brother i.e., rea...

439,Simply awesome,Best in the league... Good bass.. best sound quality... Must buy ... Also best build quality,5
440,Good quality product,"I've been using this past 6 months.

I'd say in terms of durability it matches with any sport version of Sennheiser.

Bass is high, this affects the balance.

Treble is high at 100% volume. Should listen to music at max 80% volume.

Surround sound is excellent for watching movies, since its realme buds the Dolby Atmos can be utilised to its full extent.

If the bass was not kicked up a notch and more money was put into clarity this would have matched with the likes of JBL.",4
441,Just okay,The sound quality is not much good because my brother also have Boat 220 and i have compared both side by side and i am surprised the Boat 220 have far better sound quality than Realme buds2...This is my genuine review,3
442,Classy product,"First of all delivery was super super fast!!!got delivered my buds2 in just 2 hrs after ordering it!!!best sound quality,nice design,bass super good,colour may vary different as shown in picture but good!!!flipkart,realme both doing fantabulous job!!!love the buds 2 looks super cool",5
443,Really Nice,"Expectations r more on focusing real bass but come to reality bass are not upto mark. The bass is similar to bass of samsung feature phones earphones. But surrounding effect, trepel and vocals are very clear also volume is very loud in full sound am not find any distortions. Design is good, quality of wire long lasting .Am using in MAXPROM1
CONS:
* Bass is not upto mark.
* its bass is 10% better than samsung feature phone earphones .Bass is 3.5/5

Sound quality is good
Bass is excellent

Vocals ::8/10
High tones ::7.5/10

Fabulous bass controll and sound clarity in full volume.. no noisy sound.no sound break.. best in the price ..Giving it a 4 star only because I didn't like the rope type wire through the plug..That's my personal disliking at all... Otherwise this headphone has nothing to be a second choice .,4

473,Wonderful,"Sound quality and design is superb. But i have to add something more important and considerable ::
1. Best part of this earphone is wire coating. None of the other earphone give you this feature in such a price. I know it is not much matter but it keeps ur earphone safe.
2. 2nd main part right placement of mic. Many other earphone miss this. This is necessary feature because you don't need to hold mic near ur mouth while in call.",5

When you try to listen at 80-100% volume, it sounds like a local cheap earphones. At times, for a very good scene with an awesome bgm v would want to listen at full volume. But this earphones is not meant for that. At first I thought it was because of the video/audio. Later realised it's the earphones",2
484,Nice,"Like only if you are a basshead then you can go for it. Apart from that it has a good build quality. But you can't get an earphone just for its build quality. An earphone is to provide you with quality sound which you will not get in this product. I have used JBL C100si which sound incredibly good and I am not promoting other brands here.

Especially for PUBG players are blessed to have such Realme buds 2 earphone. No delays, Clear foot steps sounds and 360 degree coverage of surrounded sounds while playing pubg and listening songs.

No earphone as of now to compare with this Realme buds.
No second thought in buying this one.",5
541,Wonderful,"This one is definitely better than the realme buds 1. It has surrounding sound good baas and a comfortable design.
I really love the build quality also.",4

544,Simply awesome,"Product is must purchase type...
However I expected good packing, it's not covered by plastic cover.
The day I got this product, it was raining....
It's just about the packaging
But I must say it's a good quality product
Thank you Flipkart
Next time I expect a good packing
Thank you.....",5
545,Excellent,"I've been using this headset for more than a month the audio output from this headset is worth more than the paid amount, it has such a great bass worth buying it.",5
546,Terrific,Thanks Realme . I never expected. It's too good quality and wire sound beat. I'm already using JBL and Skullcandy but. It's too reasonable price and awesome quality. Guy's I suggest to you . Must go for it . My next order now Realme Earbuds. Surprised🥰😘 thanks again. So happy and Fully satisfied about your product. JBL products you need to update yourself because price too much but quality no. So guy's go for realme earphone,5
547,Great product,"Wow nice product
Base nice fantastic ?

I play Call of duity Game
I am shocked if listen real sound

Fantastic base ???",5
548,Tremendous Bass,"Firstly, I'm buying this third time one for me and two for my friends, so you don't have to worry about this product, the rugged wired finish is awesome and is tangled free and also it comes with cable manager,
Apart from it, when it comes to bass, it's tremendous, just like what the Indian users likes also the mid, lows and highs are quite good, i'm quite satisfied with this product.",5
549,Wonderful,"realme buds 2 bass is good and audio quality too
but I have already used boat super bass 255f at this price 599 whose bass and audio level is same
diff is realme drivers 11.2mm boat 10mm but I found the loudness and bass same so there is no diff with extra 1.2mm drivers in realme.
I ordered this for extra bass whereas I found this same too as boat earphones.
overall I give 4/5
and 4.5/5to boat earphones",4
550,Best in the market!,The sound quality is good regarding the price point.The problem with the sound is that it is more focused on the instrumental side rather than vocals. And the concequence is that it sounds little bizarre. If it mixed up the instrumental and vocals more balanced then it would have been more soothing to listen.,5
551,Simply awesome,"Sound clarity is awesome...
It does not distort at high volume and the vocals are clear even with high music in background
Bass is kinda low punchy
Trust me if you want good sound clarity and clear vocals this is the one
If ur budget is a bit low say, rs 400 , then go for Boult audio bassbuds oak
And choose the brown color...
Have a nice day",5
552,Delightful,this earphone is really awesome but the feature I don't like is it's not support on my device properly,4
553,Fabulous!,"Pro's:

1. Sound- Loud and clear.
2. Bass - Too good for this price. Best under 1000
3. Call quality and mic - Very good.
4. Build quality - Nylon braided cable.

Cons but not really:

1. Headphone jack with/without gold coating doesn't matter much for normal usage.
2. Headphone jack shape could be better if it would be in L shape. But it mitigates the cable life by providing nylon braided wire. Normal wires with straight headphone jack will worn out soon after regular usage.",5
554,Super!,"These are the best earphones, great bass and clear voice. It is better than sennheiser cx180 street.
5 out of 5.",5
555,Just wow!,Cool and super durability. Good to say about the bass. Bass is more than expected. So I recommend to look at it,5
556,Value-for-money,"Bass isn't thumpy, but it's hydraulised. I enjoy it! ಠ_ಠ
You can cannot use this earphone at a higher volume, actually you can not increase your volume than 65%, it will cause your earpain if you take it further.
Other than that, I love it! The wire arrangement shack is just making the work easier!!! Don't think much, just go for it!",4
557,Highly recommended,"This is very Affordable In terms of Price, Design and Quality. Quality is much appreciated and Sound clarity is awsome. We can hear even a tiny detail very clear. I like em a lot.",5

Must buy ❤️",5

tips:- there are 3 different size caps available in package S M & L
use these caps to adjust lows, mids, and highs.
1. if you want everything same as earphone has, use default cap i.e size M.
2. if you need more bass then use size L caps
3. for low bass and high trouble with clear vocals use size S caps
and one more thing, no doubt this is the best earphones at this pr...

911,Best in the market!,very good quality. sounda clarity excellent. bass is there... powerful sound cant listen at high volume because it is too loud.. overall good my rating 4/5,5
912,Good quality product,must buy product... if you want good sound quality... if for only style purpose you go for Bluetooth earphones... really nice product 👌 thank you flipkart,4
913,Decent product,Build quality is very good.Bass is overpowered. The sound is not balanced.sennhieser cx180 is better option if you like balanced sound.Bass is heavy so we cant hear mids properly.so if you love bass then you can go for it but if you want balanced sound go for another earphones.,3
914,Mind-blowing purchase,Awesome Headphone . Love the built quality Love the Bass. Awesome package,5
915,Mind-blowing purchase,superb bass and awsm sound quality. good when u use it for calling purpose also. And the wire quality is also so good in this price range.,5

917,Really Nice,Realme Buds 2 Are Really Good Earphone and the Cable Organizer Is Trully The Best only the Vocal Should be more improved But The Bass Is excellent And Overall tha earphone is best in this price,4
918,Classy product,"one of the best earphones in this price range. The sound quality is of top class. If I come to the point of bass the eopper will be the boult bassloops. But If I talk about the overall sound quality, design the first boy of the class is Realme Buds 2. Very good earphones in this price range. You can go with it.",5
919,Terrific,"The best bass you can get in around 600. I was initially skeptical about realme but rating of 4.5 and good customer reviews lured me to order one. Now, after roughly 10 days of usage I'm highly satisfied with the product and it's sound quality. I have a Sony MDR EX15 which costed me Rs. 1200/- but the bass of realme beats it. You get 11mm driver just at around 600!. I highly recommend it",5
920,Does the job,"When an item has got plethora of rave reviews, you expect it to impress you largely. Sadly, Realme Buds 2 didn't do so! Except for a decent sound quality and soundscape, the headset is so mediocre. The built quality is durable and it can easily last for a year, I guess. But, who on earth can just hold on to this ordinary soundin' headset just because it is durable! Perhaps, the compatibility can be the issue with it. If your handset is any of Samsung M series, forget buying this. Or if you ca...

922,Wonderful,very rugged earfone in this price segment.i am completely satisfied wid this earfone but if realme could provide whole braided cable then it will be worth every penny.As mentioned in the box the bass is superb but the vocal is little bit low but it's negligible.out of 10 i will rate it 7 just because of half braided and half polypropylene cable.otherwise it will be 9 out of 10.apart from this the delivery was on time.and finally thanks to flipkart.,4
923,Terrific purchase,"Its good for the price but I suggest jbl cs150si because it has much better bass compared to realme buds 2 also i have tested with 3 other earphones

Mivi thunder beats =10/10
Senhiser cx 180 = 10/9
Jbl cs150si =10/8

932,Nice product,Sound quality is awesome but not clear as senhizer but as compared to senhizer it's difference of only few clearity built quality is good but its gold plated cord company should improve this and rest of quality is same as senhizer only sound clearity is too less as senhizer bass is equal as senhizer and biggest thing is that its budget earphones with extra ear buds,4

iam happy total Mark 10/10",5
935,Value for Money!,"These earphones are steal. Bass is outstanding. Good thing is bass is not disturbing other frequencies (mids, highs). Vocal are clear enough but I won't say outstanding. Instrument seperation is very nice similar to any other earphones under the price of 2000. Build quality is excellent but personally I don't like the yellow accent because it's funky for myself. If you want earphones under 500 I'll recommend to go with Honor AM115 it has same sound quality but the build is just above average....

it's attractive.
packaging is good too.

Issue 2. I use realme 3 pro so the bluetooth version is up to date but it barely gives 5ish meters range (LOS) and about 7ish meters with laptop.

Issue 3. The left and right earbuds consumes battery differently for some reason. When I use it for some time (lets's say 4 hours) I am left with 50% battery in right one and 30% in left one.

These are deal breaking issues which makes me wonder if this thing ...

Battery is awesome it don't give 10 hours of backup but minimum 3 hour and maximum 5 hour only in 1 hour of charge
Buttons perfectly work no issue in this regard.
One issue is That it's maintenance and cleaning.

5373,Great product,"Reviewing after 15 days., I have to say this is the best headphone u can get under 2000 battery backup is superb it is nearly around 10 hours build is superb, soft ear cups the only think I don't like is that these r not foldable that's sit although value for money I got it around 1300 during bbd",5
5374,Super!,"Battery Backup is awesome! It works without charging for couple of weeks on using 1-2 hours daily. Sound Quality is awesome and its same as compared to Mi wired Headphones, may be little but more. Design is awesome but wearing it more than 30-45 minutes it starts to hurt your ears. Cusion could have been much softer. Overall, its best out there and recommended to anyone.",5
5375,Excellent,"Awesome Product. I am happy and this is ultimate headphone for who travels, rides and loves music.
Once I charge it for very less time, and its battery stands for 3 or more days.
This product is worth and value for money. The build quality is also good.",5
5376,Awesome,"Sound is good and pleasant...
Earcups are comfortable....
Battery life is very Good...
Only drawback is they cant be fold
and bass is also not very High.
Hence if you are looking for Bass then go for jbl
otherwise these are the best with best design and comfort

Note- There is half a second delay while playing pubg
which in most bluetooth headphones is same...
Hence Go for the wired one or use them as wired headphones to get crystal clear sound.",5
5377,Worth every penny,Good Bass and Great battery backup. Could have improved the built quality for maximum comfort. however this is best in its price range. Ear cushion padding could have been better to absorb the swet due to continuous usage.,5

Apart from thay very good product , value for money , fast bluetooth connectivity , overall excellent product.",5
5381,Classy product,"Just wow. I m impressed with this product. Bass is op so is the look. Light-weighted but can't tell whether it will hurt your ears after wearing them for long or not coz I haven't faced it but my brother did. Beats are clear as crystal. The only thing I would have liked is that if they had added a metal strap instead of a plastic strap as the adjustable band for more durability but that won't create any issue if it is handled with care. The design is seriously lit as it gives gaming vibes. I ...

the best part is the battery . I charged it fully on the it came and it's been 7 days . I've been using aprox 3 hrs a day. and I am surprised it shows 70% battery left.
my purpose of not having a cable and not charging again and again , and getting a good comfort while using is achieved.

5428,Bad quality,"Very good product happy with it's sound quality and look. Reason for 2 stars is that it's heavy weight and its larger size makes me uncomfortable while using it and its very tight for my ears. In fact i got pain in my ears while using it for 1 hour only, for feeling comfortable i had to increase it's size and that doesn't fit in my head.

There is a second reason also that we cant carry it out of our home due to it's larger look.

Product is good for home base use.",2

Packaging was really great
Hope it helped",5

The reason behind giving 3 star was simple...!
1. Your experience may not be good as it seems to be... Because If you play Game like Pubg, cod, etc then there is a delay in the sound retrieving or in other there is a sound delay....Which I think is not desirable from my point of view as a Gamer....!
Wireless experience was bad in my case.
But....If you are using wire then it provides delightful output... Something awesome though.

Second the product is good but the sound quality is not up to the mark, u can get better sound quality from boat wired earphone which cost 450/-
When you wear the headphone, after 30 min you have to remove it for 2-3 min for getting relief from pain in ears.
It is very light weight but look very big.
The battery backup is excellent , last more than 11 hr if you use it in medium level sound.",3
5578,Terrific,"it produces a good sound and specially it's thumping bass is mind blowing. design looks cool and gives some kinda gamer look. battery backup is mind blowing. ox cable given in box is also of good quality and good length. but there are a few negative points. i.e. it's not comfortable. if u wear it for an hour u will notice pain in ur ears due to it's on the ear design and not so soft leather. music comes out and it might disturb someone nearby. but it's a good deal at 1299. loved it. you know ...

3. Connection sometimes takes a while to set up with new devices.

5642,Nice,Everything as per the price range is satisfactory except for the cushioning that has been provided. It has been observed the cushioning provided gets degraded over time. Also no extra ear or head cushions provided for future wear and tear. Quality and built is good and sound is amazing at the given price range. Should definitely include at least 1 extra pair of haed and ear cushions.,3

5700,Must buy!,"VALUE FOR MONEY....
1. Bass is Better
2. Vocals are clear
3. Comfort level is not good ( it started causing pain to my ears after 30min of usage )
4. After all best under 1500 ...
Final Verdict : Best Buy Under 1500 but remember it is not *MUST BUY*",5
5701,Brilliant,Very high rated product in this price range. Very well sound quality. Bass is not that super extra as per tagline. Comfortable & spectacular design. The bad side is it is non foldable.,5

1)Totally covers ears.
2)Comfortable
3)Design is lit.

5721,Must buy!,"Awesome value for money product, specially since I got it on offer, but its still worth 2k I'd say..Bass is the biggest plus point on this, but you need good quality music, other than that, only the glossy part would be better with matte finish, and it weighs more than the average headphone.",5

For perfect audio quality
It's good if you just want listen songs
*Not for pubg*",4
5727,Perfect product!,It is a very good looking product and you can feel that the plastic and the built look very premium but I don't feel there is any extra bass in that. The sound quality is ok but nothing impressive but the money what you are paying.. you are getting a excellent product..,5

The design is a bit flawed. it hurts my ear if I wear it for a long time. it's too tight and presses hard against your ears. softer ear cups may have solved it. I wanted to give it 4 stars for the excellent battery backup and pretty good sound quality, but it hurts my ear way too much to merit a 4 star rating.",3

But then before my warranty come to end ,I decided to replace and recently i got new one. That one too has minor defect in some parts.
ALSO THE WIRE IS NOT ENOUGH STRONG COMPARED TO THAT OF BOAT. Wire is too thin.

9661,Value-for-money,Build quality is good but not comfortable. If You have 100 rs more go for Sony ex 14. I have both Sony ex 14 and JBL C50HI. I think build quality is better than Sony ex 14 but Sony ex 14 is more comfortable than JBL and sound quality is also better.,4

Average bass
Average noise cancellation
Above average sound clarity.

However overall a good product for Rs 499/- remember, this is a base product from JBL.
If you prefer heavy bass ,for for C100 or above C150

Alternate brand is boAt, provides better noise cancellation and sound clarity than JBL in this price range, ie around Rs 600/- but JBL provide relatively heavy bass than boAt .",4

11642,Great product,Good headset under budget. I use regularly for my office meetings. Good call clarity. Nice sounds. Overall good headset under budget,5
11643,Must buy!,A very good earphones at this price point very good bass and treble the levels only form factor is that the earphones are sensitive by design need to be handled carefully....A strong thug could rip the cable off joint of the microphone or the connector....... Finally Bass 4/5 Build quality 3.5/5 Sound quality 4.5/5 Frequency rate 4/5. I personally have been into JBL earphones and headsets....would recommend these earphones.,5
11644,Simply awesome,The sound quality is too good. One of the best earphones under such a suitable price which anyone can afford easily. The product is well packed also.,5
11645,Mind-blowing purchase,"Good product with amazing sound quality

pros:
1 sound quality ; amazing

cons:
1 mic housing is made up of exceptionally cheap plastic. we feel it on each press
2 wire is prone to tangle very easily",5

Please close your eyes and buy this product if you are music lover. Note: Only little issue is with mic when you call someone you have to hold the mic or else the person on call cant listen to your voice properly. But Apart from that as i said if you just wanna listen music then just go for it.,5
11653,Classy product,"man, in 530rs I got these, sound & bass is awesome, just couple it with Dolby audio driver & it'll work on another level. Just like I'm listening in JBL T450 wired ones. just go for it instead of boat, & other brands. Best headphones so far I've ever used in this price range.",5
11654,Classy product,"Anti tangle flat wire should be there. Plastic casing of the earpods and microphone should be more hard and durable. The length of the wire is long but should be some more long to avoid any twist ot tamper. The 3.5 mm jack should be straight and thick rather than 90 degree 'L' shaped. Else the Sound, Bass, Clarity is awesome like anything even better than Sony (low segment), Senheizer, Skulcandy, Boat and Others.... JBL is a German Company and has the best technology after BOSE for sound ever...

5. Body temperature accuracy 92-95%
6. Stress Monitor accuracy 90-92%
7. Activity monitor accuracy 98-99%

Not all the times, but sometimes when you move your hand some steps are added but when you walk the accuracy is 100% and the heart rate sensor and others are very good. The lightweight body of watch is very nice. You get an average battery of 8 days or 1 week above with heavy usage. Overall it's better than the products compared at this price range.. so go for it......

19047,Does the job,If u use a custom bg as watch face it will look terrible on the watch. Steps are inaccurate as it counts even while travelling on bus. Raise to wake works only 3/5 times. Strap looks terrible after 4 months of usage. Battery backup is crazy (15 days with Bluetooth turned off else 8-10 days) Since i am not syncing with phone app i can't comment on the frequent disconnection issues others are facing.,3

I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck.
I'll make sure not to order anything .
Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more ..

Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow.
Image has too much noise in indoor shot...

If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm.

I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.

I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck.
I'll make sure not to order anything .
Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more ..

Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow.
Image has too much noise in indoor shot...

So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm.

Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges

Believe me never think to purchase it

It's very less efficient for avg class people
Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees

Print quality is not good as laser printer

Avarage uses time on internet is 8hours in a day cause of my work is mobile phone internet based , even I am getting upto 1.5-2 days battery backup. Just mind blowing and value for money. But I recommend to user plz use a silicon back cover for more effective, because the plastic cover which is given by company is not durable and it will break after maximum 3-4days.",5
23447,Good,This phone is good in this price range but only one think is very much needed in this is fast charging support and in the box fast charger adaptor which can charge the device in less time. This phone has charging 0-100 within 4-5 hours.which was too much high time,3
23448,Slightly disappointed,"Cons:- Camera is little bit bad and sound quality is whack and display covers up almost all the screen which makes playing games harder because you skin touches the side screen and you will give multiple touch response even when you don't intend too

Pros:- Very good battery life with awesome looks and value for money with. Good mobile performance.

- Reasonable camera quality based on the price range

Cons:
- Long battery charging time
- Display screen that's height wise bigger than compared to width. Height could have been a tad lesser by making it a little wider.

Best part is its made in india
And it also provides you a plastic transperant cover but that's not enough to protect ur phone...it would be just enough to protect ur phones from scratch but it breaks easily...it breaks in just 1week...mean it gets some scratches and breakouts",5

If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.,4
25633,Very Good,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.,4

I think the camera of the phone that comes under 6k to 7k is also much better than this phone's camera. One more downside of this phone is ""charger"". This phone supports 18w charging but just 10w charger is given in the box. Except these two things almost every thing is good in this phone.",4

Phone feels little heavier while comparing other phones at this price segment.
OnePlus logo is not clearly visible at backside.
Some features like ""Google Service for VR"" is not working in this model.
Overall I can give 3 rating out of 5.",3
29683,Worthless,"Being a OnePlus user for more than 5 years, with the same expectations, I ordered this phone but was utterly disappointed.

Cons: (strictly in my opinion) The display seems poor, the rear camera was not impressive, finger print sensor detection is too slow.

None, just like any other phone in the market.

Cons:
Bad design
Bulky and heavy

One plus should start treating indian citizens as second class and launch N20 here as well.",3

Why I choose this phone is only because of the Brand value.We have more other options like Vivo T1 ,Realme 9,9pro , Oppo ,Motorola.
But the OnePlus has their own premium feel
The reason why I have given only 4 star:-
1-The AMOLED display is not there.But it is not important.
2- Wide angle lens is also not there.
3- They have removed Alert slider.

Other wise the phone is perfect. I am satisfied with this device 95%.

It replaces my Huawei mobile which was much better than this phone from various aspects and was easy to access call history, dialing a number, messaging etc, for example you can't see how many times you talked to a number and call times.

32081,Expected a better product,Good Quality speakers.But very poor quality of packing by Ekart Logistics(Direct brand packed box was delivered with Bill sticked on top of it without any proper sealing and packing).Needs Improvement.Bass too heavy and uncontrollable .Overall Good sound still lags bass control.,2

32083,Moderate,There is no option to bass control ... music is very good but bass is very loud ..It's a ok ok product ...,2
32084,Could be way better,This protect is only bass boosted song only. Other songs not bass effect. so bass is not compatible..,2

32089,Slightly disappointed,"If you are an audiophile do not buy it , the bass is out of control and there is no external button or feature to control it . The treble is bad , the vocals easily gets overpowered by the bass. Sometimes in movies and music you can't hear the lyrics because of so much bass . The speaker would have been good if at least there would be a dedicated bass control switch",2

32133,Slightly disappointed,"Writting this review after 1 year of use.
Sound is okay including bass but I'm decreasing the stars only because of the connectivity issue.Any bluetooth system must reconnect automatically once device is in close distance which has to be paired with Bluetooth system but unfortunately this system doesn't reconnect automatically you would require manual connection process every time..hence over all this is main drawback from my side, rest product quality is good enough but I would not recommend...
